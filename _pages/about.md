Bernd is a lecturer in entrepreneurship at the University of Glasgow Adam Smith Business School in 2023. He previously held the same position at the University of Strathclyde and worked at Utrecht University School of Economics. He holds a PhD in Management Science, an MSc in Management of Technology, and a BEng in Mechanical Engineering. Bernd received a Fulbright Scholarship for his graduate studies in the US. His research has been published in leading international journals such as Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, the European Journal of Operational Research, and Small Business Economics.

The overarching theme of Berndâ€™s research is studying the dynamics of entrepreneurship and innovation through simple models that can answer complex questions. The first stream addresses entrepreneurial ecosystems and the impact of the regional context on entrepreneurship and vice versa. The second stream extends his doctoral research, focusing on entrepreneurial universities and academic entrepreneurship and their role in (regional) development and society through different mechanisms of external engagement. The third stream studies entrepreneurial strategy and decision-making from a systems thinking perspective, with applications to competencies and skills, networking and resource dynamics, and how entrepreneurial activities are both influenced by and influence society. Across these streams, he uses empirically and theoretically grounded models with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms that give rise to predicted or observed dynamics. This requires methodological innovation through combining different complex system approaches, predominantly system dynamics and agent-based modelling, and triangulating (novel) data sources.

Complementary to his research, Bernd is the founder of [Venturithm](https://venturithm.com), a start-up that aims to use simulations to support entrepreneurs, and also the co-founder of the [Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Research Network](https://eernetwork.org/).
