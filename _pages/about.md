I’m a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Entrepreneurship and Complexity Science at the [Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/). Before that, I held academic positions at the University of Strathclyde and Utrecht University School of Economics. I hold a PhD in Management Science, an MSc in Management of Technology, and a BEng in Mechanical Engineering.

As a researcher, educator, and entrepreneur, I work at the intersection of complex systems and entrepreneurship. My research examines how innovation and entrepreneurial activity emerge, interact, and evolve—from individual decision-making to the dynamics of ecosystems. I use, and often combine, system dynamics and agent-based modelling to build simple (but often computationally intensive) models that help answer complex questions.

Beyond academia, I’m the founder of [Venturithm](https://venturithm.com), a start-up developing simulation-based tools for entrepreneurs to make decisions with more confidence. I regularly collaborate with policy organisations such as the OECD and contribute to national and international initiatives that connect research, practice, and public policy. I’m also a co-founder of the [Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Research Network](https://eernetwork.org/).

This site brings together my research, projects, writing, and tools. It’s a work in progress—feel free to explore, reach out, or get involved.
