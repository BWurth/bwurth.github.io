Venturithm Ltd is proud to announce its acceptance into the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/workwithus/strathclydeinspire/">[University of Strathclyde Inspire]</a> accelerator programme.

This opportunity marks an exciting reunion with the University of Strathclyde, where I received my doctoral degreee and was a lecturer at the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship.

> Joining the Inspire Accelerator is a full-circle moment for me. I have a deep personal connection to this institution, having been a PhD student and faculty member here. I am excited to build on that experience, coupled with fresh perspectives, and work with the team on taking Venturithm to the next level.

Strathclyde Inspire supports entrepreneurship in all its forms across the university's ecosystem. For Strathclyde students, staff members, or alumni, there is support for:

<ul>
    <li>exploring your entrepreneurial potential, </li>
    <li>your idea for a business, or </li>
    <li>commercialising your research,</li>
</ul>

through the four stages of Explore, Create, Launch, and Grow.

Based in the heart of Scotland’s first Innovation District, GCID, the investor-ready <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/workwithus/strathclydeinspire/">[Inspire Accelerator]</a> welcomes participants on a rolling basis, ensuring you can fast-track your opportunity when the time is right. Over the course of 12-18 months, you will have access to a range of support including, but not limited to one-to-one advice; funding; bespoke training opportunities; regular cohort meetings; online presence; access to alumni, industry and partner networks; support from a virtual board; commercial champions; and pitching competitions.
