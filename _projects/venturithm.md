Venturithm is an innovative platform designed to change the way entrepreneurs develop and understand their business models. Founded in 2023 in Glasgow, our mission is to empower founders by giving them confidence in their decisions and enabling them to make sense of their assumptions and the resulting dynamics.

The Problem Entrepreneurs, particularly first-time founders and those without initial access to support, often face significant challenges in accurately understanding their new venture's potential and making informed decisions when developing their business model. They commonly rely on overly complicated spreadsheets with unrealistic projections, lacking a deep comprehension of their business model assumptions and implications. This prevailing approach not only limits entrepreneurs but also affects investors, funders, advisors, and the broader ecosystem.

Our Solution Venturithm addresses this gap by providing a highly sophisticated yet accessible platform that allows entrepreneurs to simulate and test their business models in a risk-free, virtual environment. Using advanced methodologies from complexity science, Venturithm builds a ‘digital twin’ of the new venture. This allows entrepreneurs to explore a wide range of market scenarios and customer behaviors, all based on their own data inputs. The platform guides users through the entire venture design process, from market research to business model development, breaking the process down into many small decisions that can be justified more easily.

The Platform Venturithm is a cutting-edge platform designed to help entrepreneurs simulate and test their business models in a virtual environment, enabling them to make decisions with greater confidence. Built on robust academic research, Venturithm utilizes complex systems methodologies—agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and network science—to create a ‘digital twin’ of a new venture. This allows founders to explore market scenarios and customer behaviors, significantly improving their understanding of venture dynamics. Venturithm enables founders to iterate faster, using their own data and assumptions without requiring technical expertise.
